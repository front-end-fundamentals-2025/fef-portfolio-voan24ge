      <p>
        Hi! I’m Anna Volosheniuk, a 19-year-old from Ukraine, now living and
        studying in Jönköping. I’m in my first year of the New Media Design
        program, and I truly love the mix of creativity and technology it
        offers.I already have some experience in graphic design, user experience
        design, and programming, and I’m excited to keep learning and growing. I
        enjoy turning ideas into designs that not only look great but are also
        easy to use.
