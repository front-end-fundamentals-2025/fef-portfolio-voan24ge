      <p>
        Hi! I’m Anna Volosheniuk, a 19-year-old from Ukraine, now living and
        studying in Jönköping. I’m in my first year of the New Media Design
        program, and I truly love the mix of creativity and technology it
        offers. I already have some experience in graphic design, user
        experience design, and programming. I’m excited to keep learning and
        improving. My goal is to turn my ideas into designs that not only look
        great but are also easy to use.
